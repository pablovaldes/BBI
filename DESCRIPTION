Description: The BBI package is meant to calculate Benthic Biotic Indices from
	composition data, obtained whether from morphotaxonomic inventories or
	sequencing data. Based on reference ecological weights publicly available for
	a set of commonly used marine biotic indices, such as AMBI (Borja et al., 2000)
	NSI and ISI indices (Rygg 2013). It provides the ecological quality status of
	the samples based on each BBI as well as the normalized Ecological Quality Ratio.
